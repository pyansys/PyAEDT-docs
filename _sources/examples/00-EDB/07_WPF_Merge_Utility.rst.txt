Foundation) for Windows usage. It runs a merge between two EDBs (package on board).

Execute Python script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Python script can be launched in AEDT (Tools->Run Script) 
or from the CPython command line.
This example downloads four files:

- ``package.aedb`` folder containing a package example
- ``board.aedb`` folder containing a board example
- ``merge_wizard.py`` file containing the Python script to run
- ``merge_wizard_settings.json`` file containing the settings

You can launch ``merge_wizard.py`` in AEDT (Tools->Run Script) or from the
CPython command line. The script works only on Windows with UI.

The JSON file contains default settings that can be used in any other project to automatically
load all settings.
You can edit the following lines to launch from the Python interpreter:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 44-47

.. code-block:: default


    # from pyaedt.generic.toolkit import launch
    # launch(python_file, specified_version=desktop_version, new_desktop_session=False, autosave=False)
